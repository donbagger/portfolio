As a Lead Developer Advocate at DexPaprika and CoinPaprika, I bridge the gap between development teams and the broader crypto community. I specialize in driving adoption and engagement by managing developer relations, creating educational resources, and fostering grassroots communities. I represent the company at conferences, offering technical expertise, and lead initiatives like hackathons to inspire innovation. My work involves identifying developer needs, introducing solutions aligned with market demands, and ensuring seamless communication between teams. With a focus on data-driven products, I help position DexPaprika and CoinPaprika as trusted tools for the crypto ecosystem.
